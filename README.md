# Using my materials
Firstly, I am not a lawyer. Please remember that if you feel like my wording is confusing.

Secondly, make sure that you are complying with the original author's terms and conditions when using the materials. Regarding the usage of my original songs, please read the next section.

When using my materials, including MIDI files and sheets, you are free to download and use them for your personal use. Reposting and modifying is allowed but I would appreciate it if you could credit me by linking to my YouTube channel [Electrument](https://www.youtube.com/@electrument).

*tl;dr: Feel free to use/repost/modify my content but remember to credit me because you are nice ^^.*

# Using my original contents
I would be very happy if you could inform me of the usage of my original song, but my explicit permission is not required to use/repost/modify. This means you are free to make covers, rearrange, or replay them. However, the restrictions are still from the Standard YouTube License since I mostly upload my songs to YouTube.

# The website's license
This website was licensed under the GPL-3.0 license. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/LukeNK/Electrument).

# Change of my terms and conditions
I reserved the right to change the terms and conditions without prior notice, but why would I? Here are a few possible answers:
- I made a wording/capitalization/grammar/spelling mistake;
- Fixing legal mistakes that I unintentionally made because I am not a lawyer and I do not have one;
- I have entered some legal hot water that required me to change the terms and conditions.

However, rest assured, I will try my best to refrain from unnecessarily modifying it; specifically, I want to commit to these promises:
- My materials are fully accessible and free for everybody;
- Everybody is allowed to modify and repost my materials without my explicit permission, provided that they properly credit me.

Now, let's go and spread these melodies to the world!
